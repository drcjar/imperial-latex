Things to TODO for next release:

- [X] Install Minion Pro
- [X] Install fontawesome for the letter class
- [X] Add an article class
- [X] Ensure all style files inherit from the top
- [X] Any little formatting tweaks
- [X] Improve the README to capture version control usage
- [X] vc option for imperial-conference (or beamer style)
- [X] Add a separate "project" report class

Wishlist
- [ ] Nice substitutes if font not available.  See http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/53443/how-to-check-if-a-font-exists-in-xelatex
- [ ] Consolidate all of the version control stuff into
  imperial-common.  It works now but it's scattered across three
  sub-files, which makes it harder to maintain.  There should be a
  master \getversion command that gets the formatted version data if
  used.
