% The text of the letter starts here
The name computer comes from ``to compute'' meaning to
calculate. Computers were developed originally to do the maths humans
were too slow to do. The technological development that allowed the
birth of modern computers is the transistor. Transistor devices could
be made to hold a given voltage, a high or a low. Hence, if we connect
many transistors we can represent a series made up of 0 (low) and 1
(high). The binary number system can represent any number in 1s and
0s, which means that transistors can represent any number (or a code
made up of binary numbers).

To do a calculation two things are needed: a place to hold the
numbers, the operation and the result, and a brain to do it. Inside a
computer, the first is the memory, and the second is the Central
Processor Unit(CPU). The CPU and memory must communicate to exchange
information. This communication is done via the bus. Also, the
computer needs to receive the information from somewhere and it needs
to send the result somewhere. These two operations are called INPUT
and OUTPUT. This very simple model still holds today.

One important element that is missing in this simple picture is
timing. Pulses of voltages (high or low) can change state at a certain
rate. This rate determines how fast the computer can ``think''. So
computers must have a clock. The clock speed is what computer
manufacturers quote when selling computers (in Megahertz). This rate
is never achieved in practice by the CPU, and much less by the
transfer of information between memory and disk. Hence, the rate
should be taken only as a guide but not as the actual speed of the
computer.
